            <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
            <p>The School of Public Health(SPH) of Southeast University was founded in 1976. Presently, SPH comprises 1 post-doctoral research station of Public Health & Preventive Medicine, 4 Ph.D. programs of Occupational and Environmental Health, Hygienic Toxicology, Epidemiology and Health Statistics and Nutrition and Food Hygiene. 6 master’s programs and master of public health program (MPH). A key discipline of Jiangsu Province in Public Health & Preventive Medicine is honored. Moreover, SPH has one key laboratory of environmental medicine engineering of Ministry of Education, one provincial key laboratory of biomaterials & instruments and city key laboratory of occupational & Biological Safety. The discipline ranks 7 in China in 2012 by Ministry of Education of China.</p>
            <p>Among its over 48 faculty members, there are 16 full professors and 15 associate professors.</p>

            <p>By taking fully advantages of Southeast University as national key comprehensive university with engineering as its focus and co-operating closely with Environment Science & Engineering, Biomedicine and Materials disciplines and so on, SPH has made great achievements in postgraduate education and high lever scientific research, such as cancer prevention, nutrition and chronic diseases, water pollution and health, safety assessment of biomaterials, nanotoxicology etc. From 2010-2013, SPH undertakes more than 40 national, ministerial and provincial research programs, 380 research papers published, 30 patents obtained and made publicity. In addition, it has established academic links with institutions of Germany, United States, British, Australia, Italia, Japan and Hong Kong, Taiwan areas.</p>
            <p>SPH has set up an environmental medicine engineering innovation Platform; the laboratory covers a total area of 6000 squares meters, advanced research instruments such as HPLC-MS, GC-MS, Spectrometry, Atomic Absorption Spectrometry, Plasma Emission Spectrometer, Double Beam Spectrofluorophotometer, Fluorescent Quantitative PCR, Flow Cytometer, Agarose Gel Images Processing, Ultraviolet ELISA, Fluorescent ELISA, 2D Electrophoresis, Transmission Electronmicroscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy. etc.</p>
